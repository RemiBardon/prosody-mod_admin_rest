# mod_admin_rest

A RESTful admin interface to [Prosody](http://prosody.im/) XMPP server.

### Why

There are a few ways to administer Prosody; by using either the `mod_admin_telnet`, `mod_admin_adhoc`, or via `prosodyctl`. mod_admin_rest seeks to enable a more programmatic interface to Prosody commands that exist in the stock admin modules, and some commands that don't.

### Note

+ Compatible with `v0.9`. Not tested and likely incompatible with previous versions.
+ It's highly advisable to install [lua-cjson](http://www.kyne.com.au/~mark/software/lua-cjson.php). `mod_admin_rest` will use it if it is available.

### Installation

1. Place `mod_admin_rest.lua` in your `plugins` directory.
2. Add `admin_rest` to `modules_enabled` list of your `prosody.cfg.lua`
3. Start or restart Prosody

## Issuing commands

This module depends on Prosody's `http` module, so it inherits the `http` module's configuration. You do not need to add `http` to the enabled modules list; it is loaded automatically. By default, http server listens on port `5280`. All requests must contain Basic authentication for a user who has administrative privileges.
HTTP Basic access authentication is one of the easiest authentication methods and it's only safe with a secure SSL/HTTPS connection. The header generated is: ("Authorization" is the Headerfieldname and "Basic {TOKEN}" the Value.)

> `Authorization: Basic {TOKEN}`

where the {TOKEN} is the base 64 of the username and password separated by a colon. In pseudo-code, it would be:

> `base64(username + ':' + password)`

Requests with bodies must contain `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers. Additionally, some `admin_rest` commands may require request bodies. `mod_admin_rest` attempts to make appropriate use of HTTP status codes and request methods. Request paths have the following general structure:

> /admin_rest/`operation`/`resource`/`attribute`

Responses are JSON-encoded objects with a `result` property. They have the form:

> `{ result: { ... } }`

## Commands

A handful of useful commands are supported. More will come in the future.

### get user

If the user does not exist, response status code is `404`. Otherwise `200`. If a user is offline, response will contain `connected=false` and empty roster/session lists.

> **GET** /admin_rest/user/`username`

```
{
  user: {
    connected: true,
    sessions: [ ... ],
    roster: [ ... ]
  }
}
```

Each `session` item in the `sessions` list has the following structure:

```
{
  resource: "",
  secure: true,
  port: 1337,
  ip: 127.0.0.1,
  id: "f8fhfw3"
}
```

**Status codes**

+ `200` User connected, successful
+ `404` User does not exist or not connected

---------------------------------------

### get user connected

Unlike `get user`, this will not respond with stringified user content, which can be quite verbose as it contains session data. This command will respond with a `200` status code if the user is connected.

> **GET** /admin_rest/`username`/connected

Response:

```
{ connected: true }
```

**Status codes**

+ `200` User connected
+ `404` User not connected

---------------------------------------

### get connected users

If command complete successfully, an array of user objects is returned, with status code `200`. If no users are connected, an empty object is returned.

> **GET** /admin_rest/users

```
{
  count: count,
  users: {
    [ { username, resource }, ... ]
  }
}
```

---------------------------------------

### get connected users count

Get just the count of connected users.

> **GET** /admin_rest/users/count

```
{
  count: count
}
```

---------------------------------------

### add user

Adds a user. If the user exists, updates their password and responds with status code `200`. If the user is successfully created, `201`.

> **POST** /admin_rest/user/`username`

Include `password` in the request body (`regip` is optional).

```json
{
  password: "mypassword",
  regip: "ipadress"
}
```

**Status codes**

+ `201` User created
+ `200` User already exists

---------------------------------------

### remove user

Removes a user. If the user does not exist, responds with status code `200`. If the user is successfully removed, `200`.

> **DELETE** /admin_rest/user/`username`

**Status codes**

+ `200` User deleted
+ `200` User does not exist

---------------------------------------

### change user attributes

Supported attributes:

- `password`
- `role` (see [Roles and permissions â€“ Prosody IM](https://prosody.im/doc/developers/permissions))
  - FYI, built-in roles are defined in `mod_authz_internal.lua` (under section `-- Default roles`).

Ultimately roster modifications may be implemented. Supply values for attributes in the request body as encoded JSON:

> **PATCH** /admin_rest/user/`username`/`attribute`

```
{ attribute: value }
```

Example: For changing a user's password. Assuming user's name is `testuser`

> **PATCH** /admin_rest/user/testuser/password

With request body:

```
{ password: "mypassword" }
```

**Status codes**

+ `200` User was updated successfully
+ `400` Invalid modification
+ `404` User does not exist

If a user was updated successfully, response status code is `200`. If a user does not exist, response status code is `404`.

---------------------------------------

### get roster of user

Get the rosters of the user.
If command complete successfully, an array of roster objects is returned, with status code `200`. If no roster, an empty object is returned.

> **Get** /admin_rest/roster/`username`

```
{
  count: count,
  roster: {
    [["item",{"jid":"jid1","subscription":"both","group":["group1"]}], ... ]
  }
}
```

**Status codes**

+ `200` Get roster

---------------------------------------

### add roster to user

Add a roster to a user. If the contact user does not exist, response status code is `404`. If a user is successfully removed, `200`.

> **Add** /admin_rest/roster/`username`

With request body:

```
{ contact: "roster jid" }
```

**Status codes**

+ `200` Roster added
+ `404` Contact does not exist or is malformed

---------------------------------------

### remove roster from user

Removes a roster from a user. If the contact user does not exist, response status code is `404`. If a user is successfully removed, `200`.

> **DELETE** /admin_rest/roster/`username`

With request body:

```
{ contact: "roster jid" }
```

**Status codes**

+ `200` Roster deleted
+ `404` Contact does not exist or is malformed

---------------------------------------

### send message

Send a message to a particular user on a particular host. Messages are sent from the hostname. Include the content of your message in a JSON-encoded request body.

> **POST** /admin_rest/message/`username`

```
{ message: "My message" }
```

**Status codes**

+ `200` Message sent
+ `202` Message delayed (sent to offline queue)
+ `404` User does not exist

---------------------------------------

### send multicast

Send bulk messages to a number of particular users. Request body should contain an array of JSON objects, each with a `to` and `message` attribute.

> **POST** /admin_rest/message

```
{
  [
    { to: "testuser", message: "My message" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

If any messages were multicasted, response status code is `200`, and response body has the following form, where `s` is the number of messages sent, and `d` is the number of messages delayed (to be sent to offline queue).

```
  {
    result: "Message multicasted to users: s/d"
  }
```

**Status codes**

+ `200` Message sent
+ `404` No messages were sent; no valid recipients were found

### broadcast message

Send a message to every connected user using a particular host. Messages are sent from the hostname. Include the content of your message in a JSON-encoded request body.

> **POST** /admin_rest/broadcast

```
{ message: "My message" }
```

  "name": "String, required",
  "create_default_muc": false,
  "group_id": "String, optional"
}
```

Only `name` is required, undefined `create_default_muc` and `group_id` are handled by `mod_groups_internal:create`.

`<group_id>` in the path takes precedence over `group_id` in the body.

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "group_id": "kL5Qb4OHTPbS"
}
```

**Status codes:**

+ `200` Group created successfully
+ `400` Invalid body

+ `500` Internal server error

#### Delete group

Calls `mod_groups_internal:delete`.

> `DELETE /admin_rest/groups/<group_id>`

**No body.**

**Example response:**

{
  "delay_update": false
}
```

`delay_update` is optional. Undefined `delay_update` is handled by `mod_groups_internal:create`.

**Example response:**

```text
Member 'remi' successfully added to group 'kL5Qb4OHTPbS'.
```

**Status codes:**

+ `200` Member successfully added to group
+ `404` Group not found
+ `500` Internal server error

#### Remove group member

Calls `mod_groups_internal:remove_member`.

> `DELETE /admin_rest/groups/<group_id>/members/<member_id>`

**No body.**

**Example response:**

```text
Group 'kL5Qb4OHTPbS' deleted successfully.
```

**Status codes:**

+ `200` Group deleted successfully
+ `500` Internal server error

## Options

Add any of the following options to your `prosody.cfg.lua`.  You may forward additional HTTP options to Prosody's `http` module.

**admin_rest_secure** boolean

Whether incoming connections must be secure. Default is `false`.

```
admin_rest_secure = false;
```

**admin_rest_base** string

Base path. Default paths begin with `/admin_rest`.

```
admin_rest_base = "/admin_rest";
```


**admin_rest_whitelist** array

List of IP addresses to whitelist. Only these IP addresses will be allowed to issue commands over HTTP.

```
admin_rest_whitelist = {
  "127.0.0.1"
};
```

If you modify the whitelist while Prosody is running, you will need to reload `admin_rest` module. One way you can do this is by connecting to `admin_telnet` service which runs by default on port `5582`.

```
$ echo "module:reload('admin_rest', <host>)" | nc localhost 5582
```

Alternatively, you may use `admin_rest` to reload itself by issuing a [load](https://github.com/Weltschmerz/mod_admin_rest#load-module) request to itself. Example:

> **PUT** /admin_rest/module/admin_rest

Better still, you may use `admin_rest` itself to [add](https://github.com/wltsmrz/mod_admin_rest#add-to-whitelist) or [remove](https://github.com/wltsmrz/mod_admin_rest#remove-from-whitelist) IPs from whitelist while in operation.

**admin_rest_message_prefix** string

**admin_rest_multicast_prefix** string

**admin_rest_broadcast_prefix** string

Optional message prefixes
